			<h2>Bridging the future of media and tech</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
		Are you passionate about the role that emerging technologies can play in the future of storytelling and journalism? Do you have a story that can only be told using technology outside the scope of traditional media? If so, you might be a perfect candidate for a Magic Grant from the Brown Institute for Media Innovation.
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>At Base Camp, you will work in interdisciplinary, bicoastal teams to develop new ideas and plans for media innovation that may result in Magic Grant projects. Brown Fellows, industry experts and faculty will be on hand to provide feedback, support and guidance.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		You don't need a concrete idea or team to participate--interest in media innovation is what we're looking for!

			<h2>About Brown and the Magic Grants</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
		Established in 2012, the <a href="http://www.brown.columbia.edu" target="">David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute</a> is a collaboration between Columbia University and Stanford University, designed to encourage and support new endeavors in media innovation. At Stanford, the primary focus is on media technology, and the Institute is anchored in the School of Engineering. At Columbia, the primary focus is on content, and the Institute is anchored in the Graduate School of Journalism.
		</p>
		<p>
		Once per year, we invite the Columbia and Stanford communities to submit proposals for Magic Grants. We look for ideas that are original and have the potential to bring true innovation in the media world.
