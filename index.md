			<h2>Bridging the future of media and tech</h2>

			<strong style="color: rgba(255,255,255,.4)">
				At Base Camp, you will work in interdisciplinary, bicoastal teams to develop new ideas and plans for media innovation that may result in Magic Grant projects. Brown Fellows, industry experts and faculty will be on hand to provide feedback, support and guidance.

			Are you passionate about the role that emerging technologies can play in the future of storytelling and journalism? Do you have a story that can only be told using technology outside the scope of traditional media? If so, you might be a perfect candidate for a Magic Grant from the Brown Institute for Media Innovation.
		</p>
		<p>
			You don't need a concrete idea or team to participate--interest in media innovation is what we're looking for! Take a look at <a href="http://brown.columbia.edu/magic">last year's projects</a> to see the variety of work we fund.
