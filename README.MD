Basecamp at The Brown Institute
===============================
Weekends where Story and Technology collide at Stanford University and Columbia University
_____________________________

Basecamps are weekend events we run at The Brown Institute to bring together students from Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and Stanford Engineering to learn how build interdisciplinary projects together.

If you've got an idea for an interdisciplinary project - maybe even one suited for a [Magic Grant](http://brown.columbia.edu/propose) - and are looking for collaborators, or are interested in working in a project and are looking for the right team to join, we're here to help and you're in the right place.

Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/browninstitute/basecamp/issues) connected with this GitHub repository to see if there's anyone or any projects or collaborators that seem interesting or exciting (and let them know with a comment). Then, you can create a new issue as an opportunity to introduce yourself and/or your project.
