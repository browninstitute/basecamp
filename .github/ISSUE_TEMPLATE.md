# Introducing Yourself and/or your Project: Instructions
Edit the below text to introduce yourself to other Basecampers. This intro is formatted using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you want to style your text (or understand what's been written).

Fill in the text below to let others know who you are, and what you're looking to collaborate on. Afterwords, use the labels (on the right-hand side of this page) to describe your intro (i.e. you're from Columbia, and looking for collaborators on your project idea). And be sure to delete this above section so others can get right into the good stuff.

Good luck!

# Hi I'm [YOUR NAME HERE]
* [ ] Stanford University
* [ ] Columbia University

I'm studying [...]

## I'm Interested in...
* Several things that you find fascinating right now
* They can be part of your academic studies or not
* And to keep adding bullet points, just keep adding more of these `*`

## Several skills I have are
* What makes you see things differently
* Or what can you do really, really well
* Or have just learned to do that few others are capable of

# Here's my project idea
If you don't have a project idea, you can delete the rest of this template.

If you have a project idea, use this area to introduce it to an audience who's never seen it before. Importantly, know that many of the folks reading this will come from very different intellectual backgrounds as you, so make sure you're explaining it in a way that someone from a different field can get just as excited or passionate as you.

## I'm looking for help with:
* list the things you'll have to do
* and the kinds of skills you'll need to join you to make it happen
